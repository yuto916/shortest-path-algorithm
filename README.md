# Shortest Path Algorithm


## Discription
This project is a basic implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm in Python to find the shortest path in a weighted, undirected graph.


## Features
-- Calculates the shortest distance from a start node to a target node, or to all other nodes if no target is specified.
-- Prints both the distance and the path taken.
